# Consistent Hashing

As we have already seen many approaches to distributing load across multiple machines involves hashing some piece of data and then using modulo arithmetic to pick which node receives the data.

This chapter will explore consistent hashing - a technique to avoid moving all data when the number of destinations changes.

## The Algorithm

## An Example
